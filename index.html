                <h2>Aspiring programmer</h2>
                <p>I love to design foulproof solutions for seemingly unsolvable problems. I'm deeply interested in the
                    field
                    of computer science and everyday I work hard to expand my knowledge in this fast evolving
                    environment.

                <h3>A logic gate</h3>
                <p>It is an idealized or physical device implementing a Boolean function; that is, it performs a logical
                    operation on one or more binary inputs and produces a single binary output.</p>
                <h3> ASCII </h3>
                <p>It stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange. Computers can only understand
                    numbers,
                    so
                    it is the numerical representation of a character such as 'a' or '@' or an action of some sort.</p>
                <h3>Random-access memory (RAM) </h3>
                <p>It is a form of computer data storage which stores frequently used program instructions to increase
                    the
                    general speed of a system. It can be randomly accessed. Data items to be read or written in almost
                    the
                    same
                    amount of time irrespective of the physical location of data inside the memory.</p>
                <h3>Programming language</h3>
                <p>A formal language that specifies a set of instructions that can be used to produce various kinds of
                    output.
                    They generally consist of instructions for a computer and can be used to create programs that
                    implement
                    specific algorithms.</p>
                <h3>Domain Name System (DNS)</h3>
                <p>A hierarchical decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to
                    the
                    Internet or a private network. It associates various information with domain names assigned to each
                    of
                    the
                    participating entities.</p>
                <h3>Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</h3>
                <p>An application protocol for distributed, collaborative, and hypermedia information systems. It is the
                    foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web. It is the standard protocol to exchange or
                    transfer
                    hypertext.</p>
